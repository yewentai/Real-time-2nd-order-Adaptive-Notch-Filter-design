* The written report needs to summarize the **implementation steps** of the ANF algorithm. 
* You will **evaluate** your implementation (what works, what doesnâ€™t work, what could be improved)
* **discuss** the performed functional tests and validations of both C and Assembler implementations. 
* You will also need to include a **computational cost analysis** for both C and ASM implementations
* **motivate your choice of fixed-point Q-factor for each variable** in the ANF-LMS algorithm. 



* The report will be graded on the correct use of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. 
* The report ought to be easy to read, and its contents presented in a logical order. 
* Add personal creativity to your report by including images, tables, additional testing, and so on.
